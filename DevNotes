Following are the work to be done next:

1) Create a curl library (i.e. a curl.h and a curl.c file) # Done

It should have the following functions for V1.0:
curl_post_object(char *object_name)
curl_put_object(char *object_name)
curl_get_object(char *object_name)
curl_delete_object(char *object_name)

2) Come up with the architecture of FSAL_S3 # Done

Understand the working of s3fs-fuse especially the mapping of 
files/directories to objects/directores

3) Complete s3_init_config(): # Done

For V1.0, this function should initialize CURL (If required) 
and check if the bucket exists.
For now, bucket_name, access_key, access_secret_key can be hardcoded

4) Complete mkdir.c 

5) Complete s3_lookup_path(path): # Ajay

For V1.0, this function should get the path and check 
if the object with that path exist

6) Complete setattr and getattr

7) Run nfs-ganesha over FSAL_S3
